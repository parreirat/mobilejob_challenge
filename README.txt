Notes:
  - A lot of refactoring should be done on tests.
  - Should test MovieRenter::Customer#statement components separately.
  - Should define singleton methods on MovieRenter::Movie to get the price
    codes in an easier fashion.
  - Would work more on this but I've spent about ~2h30m on this so far, which
    is above the stated 2h, and I have a lot more things to do.
